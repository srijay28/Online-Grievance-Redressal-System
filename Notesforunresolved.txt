Change the color of "Not Viewed".
Look at where to begin to add "Unresolved":
1) Add an Unresolved Grievances Page in Student (Copy Resolved Greivances)
2) Configure the php file for the Unresolved Page in Student Login
3) Start with the Staff Login Unresolved Page:
    (i) Add an unresolved option in View All Complaints
    (ii) Edit View all so that Unresolved Complaints do not appear on that page
    (iii) Adding AllUnresolved Page 
    (iv) Configuring JS and php for AllUnresolved page
